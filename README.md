# Assignment-1-Data-Collection-and-Curation
My goal of this project is inform Austin residents about the Austin public institutions' social media preference. By letting them know about this preference, if there was a issues in the city, like a winter storm, Ausitn residents can search public institution social media easily and get information efficiently. In my experience, when there was boiling water alert in Austin, I could not find addtional information about why we should not drink water without boiling because I do not know which branch of public instituion uses which social media to inform Austin residents.
